Login Simulation: Base Version
- Able to Register an email and password for a user
- Able to Successfully reject invalid logins and accept valid logins

Ways to improve upon this:
- Be able to store registered people in something beyond a state
- Be able to not have to pass state as a prop between Components
- Be able to not have repeating nested components, bad practice

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App
