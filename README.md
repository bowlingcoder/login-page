Login Simulation: Single Component
- Able to Register an email and password for a user
- Able to Successfully reject invalid logins and accept valid logins
- Minimizing unnecessary nesting components
- Minizing passing states between components

Ways to improve upon this:
- Be able to store registered people in something beyond a state
- Look into trying designing multiple pages for the registration, login, and content 

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App
